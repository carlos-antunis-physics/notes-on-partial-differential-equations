#   Minicourse on Partial Differential Equations

>   **Autor:** [Carlos Antunis Bonfim da Silva Santos](https://github.com/carlos-antunis-physics/)

The goal of this minicourse was to delve into the expansive field of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These equations serve as powerful tools for modeling a diverse array of natural phenomena â€” from quantum effects at nanometer scales and femtosecond timescales, to fluid dynamics in everyday life, and even the evolution of galaxies over billions of years.

The course has provided an opportunity to explore various types of PDEs, balancing breadth with depth. It covers their analytical properties and introduces numerical methods to approximate solutions, aiding in understanding and visualizing their behaviors. Fundamental analytical tools are also studied, which are essential for proving the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions, as well as ensuring the convergence of numerical approximations.

By combining theoretical insights with practical techniques, this minicourse aimed to offer a comprehensive understanding of PDEs. This knowledge was intended to equip us with the skills to address real-world problems and foster a deeper appreciation for these mathematical tools.
